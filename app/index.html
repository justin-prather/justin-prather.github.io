              <p>At Bradon Equestrian we are committed to the development of horse and rider in the jumper ring. The facility is owned and operated by Brad and Valerie Prather. It was developed out of a desire by the Prather Family to train on the west side of Calgary in a first class facility with quality training and horse care. Through their children, the Prather&#8217;s have been involved in show jumping from the lead line to the Grand Prix ring for over a decade. They also own horses that have competed at the international level in Canada, the United States and Europe with Jill Henselwood, a member of the Canadian Equestrian Team.</p>
<p>As parents and owners, the Prathers understand the investment and commitment required to compete in the show jumping world. With this unique perspective, the Prathers offer boarding and training at their facility and are committed to providing members of Bradon Equestrian with the same level of training, facilities, equine care, and transparency in the purchase and sale of horses that they have come to expect for themselves.</p>
